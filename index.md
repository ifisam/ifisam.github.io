I am an aspiring researcher in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), currently pursuing my Master's degree at Universität Trier, Germany. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh Army University of Science and Technology.

My research interests focus on Human-Computer Interaction, Large Language Models, and their application in creating more intuitive and human-like digital assistants. I am particularly passionate about bridging the gap between complex AI models and practical, user-centric applications.

Currently, I am working on projects involving Digital Twins and Industrial Metaverse at Robert Bosch GmbH, where I apply my skills in simulation and AI to real-world industrial challenges. Previously, I have gained experience in data analysis and software development through various roles.

I am driven by the goal of contributing to the advancement of NLP and pursuing a PhD in this exciting field. This website serves as a "second brain" to document my learning, share my research updates, and connect with the wider academic community.
